Pre-Session Primer: Cell Structure &amp; Microscopy (Combined)</h1>
<h2 id="welcome-to-intensive-a-level-biology">Welcome to Intensive
A-Level Biology!</h2>
<p>This primer will help you prepare for our first <strong>extended
session</strong> covering both microscopy AND complete cell structure.
Since we have only 33 weeks to cover everything, our first session
combines what would normally be two separate topics. Don’t worry if you
can’t answer everything - these questions are to get you thinking about
the topics we’ll explore together.</p>
